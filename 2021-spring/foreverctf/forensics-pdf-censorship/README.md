## Steps
#### Step 1
In this problem, the flag is hidden in the blacked out sections. The thing is, whoever tried to hide the text did a bad job-- you are still able to highlight and find the text on the PDF. Using the hints (or if you've encountered this type of problem before), you should be able to figure out how to recover the text (using a tool like `pdftotext` or just highlighting everything in the PDF) and get the flag: `utflag{see_the_unseen}`.
